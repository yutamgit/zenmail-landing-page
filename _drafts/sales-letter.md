Dear Mr. Sugie,

For as little as $4.99/month or $49/year you can tame your inbox once and for all. We are in an age
flooded with noise. Our inbox gets bombarded with newsletters, sales offers, and promotions. Most of
the emails we receive are unimportant -- yet, we feel the need to keep checking our inbox from fear
of missing out and to get the adrenaline rush.

You'll love zenmail because...

- Less time on your device means more time to do what matters most to you.
- You'll realize that you don't need to be in your inbox throughout the day.
- It will create an environment that locks you out of your inbox. No more constant refreshing to
  see if anything new has come your way.
- It creates a time limit on your inbox time -- which means you'll be getting your email duties done
  faster.
- Everything is secure. Your email credentials and sensitive information stay on your device.

**Satisfaction is guaranteed** - if you are not happy with the app and service we promise to make it
right.
